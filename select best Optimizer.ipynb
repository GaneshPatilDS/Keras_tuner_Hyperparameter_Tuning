    " This code is an example of how to use a library called Keras Tuner to automatically search for the best hyperparameters for a neural network model. Let me explain it step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining the Model (build_model function):**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - In this part, you're defining the structure of your neural network model. It's a simple model with two layers: one with 32 neurons and a ReLU activation function, and another with 1 neuron and a sigmoid activation function. This model is used for a binary classification task (like classifying emails as spam or not spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compiling the Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Here, you specify how your model should be trained. You define:\n",
    "     - `LOSS_FUNCTION`: This is a measure of how well your model is doing. It's used to guide the training process.\n",
    "     - `OPTIMIZER`: This is the optimization algorithm that adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the loss. The type of optimizer (Adam, SGD, etc.) is one of the hyperparameters that will be tuned.\n",
    "     - `METRICS`: These are the measurements used to evaluate the model's performance during and after training, like accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Setting Up Hyperparameter Tuning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You create a tuner object (`tuner`) using Keras Tuner. This object will help you search for the best combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "   - You specify that you want to maximize the validation accuracy (`objective = 'val_accuracy'`), which means you want to find the hyperparameters that lead to the highest accuracy on your validation data.\n",
    "   - You set a limit on the number of trials (`max_trials = 5`), which controls how many different sets of hyperparameters will be tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Searching for Best Hyperparameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You start the hyperparameter search by calling `tuner.search()`. This function trains multiple versions of your model with different hyperparameters to find the best combination.\n",
    "   - It uses your training data (`X_train` and `y_train`) and validates the model's performance on your test data (`X_test` and `y_test`) during each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Getting the Best Hyperparameters and Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After the search is complete, you can retrieve the best set of hyperparameters using `tuner.get_best_hyperparameters()[0].values`. This tells you the values of the hyperparameters that resulted in the best validation accuracy.\n",
    "   - You can also get the best model found during the search using `tuner.get_best_models(num_models=1)[0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Training the Best Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Finally, you train the best model found with the best hyperparameters for more epochs to further fine-tune it. This is done using `model.fit()`. You train it on your training data (`X_train` and `y_train`) and evaluate its performance on your test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this code is to find the best combination of hyperparameters (like the optimizer type) to make your neural network perform as well as possible on your specific task (binary classification). It does this by trying out different hyperparameter settings, training models, and selecting the one with the highest validation accuracy. This helps ensure that your model is well-configured for your data and problem."
